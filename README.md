# Terminal_Secured_Chat

This project allows multiple users to communicate via a chat in a terminal, messages are encrypted to allow for a secure chat experience

## Motivation

I love Discord but you never know if the message you just sent to your friend is 100% private.

When i want to send the netflix password to my girlfriend or share private informations I want to have a secured way to do it without my informations getting sold, that's why i made this project.

It also allowed me to practice managing html servers and encrypting to make safe web applications.
